# Stock-Grok â€“ Groww Assignment

A React Native (Expo) application developed as part of the React Native Intern assignment for Groww. This application enables users to explore top market movers (gainers and losers), track ETFs and stocks, manage personalized watchlists, and view detailed company information through interactive line charts.

With the API limit of 25 calls per day, building this app presented a challenge. What initially appeared as a straightforward implementation evolved into a valuable learning experience in caching strategies and efficient API utilization.
